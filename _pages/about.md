<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a joint PhD student at Zhejiang University and the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence [(BIGAI)](https://www.bigai.ai).
My research mainly focuses on Embodied AI, Reinforcement Learning and World Model.
Previously, I received my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Sun Yat-sen University.
